## Me

![Christian](https://github.com/lukeperson/ComSSA_Wiki/blob/master/Christian_Brunette/images/main_photo.jpg)

I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science (Comp Sci), majoring in Cyber Security after 5 years at Uni. I spent 2 years in Mechatronic engineering before finding my love for programming and Cyber. (It’s OKAY to change degrees!).
Once I switched degrees to computer science, I immediately tried to get involved with the community at Curtin. I became a tutor, I worked with ComSSA as a committee member, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in the labs, making friends, studying and talking shit with all the awesome people that hang out there. 
After graduating, I took a role as a Cyber Integration Engineer, working for Leidos in Canberra. 

## Beating Uni
### Go to tutorials.
This part sucks, especially if you have a tutorial at a bad time (early mornings are the worst for me). BUT, tutorials are the number one learning resource **if used correctly**. If you just go to the tutorial and sit there without asking questions and interacting with the tutor, you are wasting your time. The whole point of tutorials are for you to ask questions with whatever you are stuck on and to get help. 
Side tip: If your tutorial is truly at a bad time for you, or if you simply need more than one tutorial session to ask all your questions, then **go to other tutorial sessions**. There are often rosters posted for when tut’s are running for various units, and nothing is stopping you from rocking up to other tutorials. This can be especially good if you don’t feel like you’re getting the most value from a specific tutor.  (If the class is already full, you may have to make room for someone who is actually enrolled there, but generally the classes are barely half full!)

### Form a friends / study group.
Studying with others is a great way to make studying less shit. I am generally a very introverted person, and even I got a lot of value from studying with 2-3 people on weekends. Grab one of the lab rooms, use the whiteboard, ask each other exam questions and solve them together.

### Practice exam questions.
I hinted to this in the previous dot point. Past exam/test questions are your number one resource to beat exams. BUT… If you just **look** at the exam, and then **look** at the solutions, you are wasting your time. Seriously. You have to actually try to solve the problem first, that’s the only way to get better. If you cannot solve the exam questions, don’t look at the solution. Go and ask a tutor or friend to solve it **with you**. 

## How do I get an Interview?
-	Take the time to create a resume. This is a one time investment that makes a big difference later on. 
-	Tailor your resume to the job role. Make tweaks in your resume to highlight the parts of your experience / personal projects which show you are the perfect candidate for the specific tole.
-	 Apply for everything. And I mean everything. If you’re a web developer and there’s a role for a penetration tester, APPLY. If you hear nothing back, you’ve lost nothing. If they do get back to you, be honest, and don’t try to BS that you are a great pen-tester. Simply state that you’re interested in the field and are willing to learn, and highlight the parts of web-dev that are transferrable skills to the role you applied for. If nothing else, you will gain valuable experience in conducting an interview, as well as some insight into a role you would have otherwise known nothing about.

## Winning at the Interview
-	**You will be rejected, a lot**. Get used to it, its not a big deal. You only have to win at **one** interview to get a job. The rest don’t matter.

-	Personal Projects.
I can’t stress this enough. DO STUFF outside of uni. Interviewers really look at this, because it sets you apart from the other 200 people doing the same degree as you. This can be anything from a woodworking project, to being a part of the ComSSA LAN’s, to trying to code your own game engine. Importantly, whatever the project is, **it doesn’t have to be successful, and it doesn’t have to be related to your degree**. You can use these projects as talking points for how you learned from failure, how you improved a skill, or even how you just had some fun while trying something new. 
It may seem unintuitive, but talking about extracurriculars was the number one thing that got me job offers. (Side tip, after interviews, email back and ask for feedback. It says a lot about your character, and you get great tips as to what worked and didn’t work.) 

-	Be a problem solver.
Often during an interview you will get at least one technical question. In my experience, it was often something I had never seen or had the opportunity to practice, and that’s OK. The point of the question is not to see what you can regurgitate or memorise, it’s to see how you approach and solve a problem.
-	Look at the question carefully. 
-	Ask clarifying questions.
-	Talk through your thought process, and use the interviewer as a sounding board for your idea.
-	As a last resort, if you can’t solve the problem after a solid try – **don’t be afraid to admit defeat**. Honesty is always the best approach. If you’ve made a solid effort and admit defeat, I would count that as a success.

-	Be professional.
This is an obvious one.
Dress appropriately for interviews. If you are unsure what would be appropriate, **ASK**. You can ask the interviewer over email, it may feel embarrassing, but I guarantee they don’t care a single bit. And… it’s less embarrassing than rocking up to an interview in a café with a full suit, when the interviewer is wearing a t-shirt and jeans.
Outside of interviews, be mindful that people around you can often influence (positively or negatively) your opportunities for jobs. If you are generally professional to colleagues, tutors, lecturers and others at Uni, it’s more likely that they will talk about you in a positive manner, which impacts how you are perceived by the wider community.
