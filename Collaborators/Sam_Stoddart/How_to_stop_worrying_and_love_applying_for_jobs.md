Transitioning from Uni to Industry is one of the most stressful parts of starting your career, but it's also one of the most rewarding and exciting times :) Applying for jobs is tricky at first, but the good news is that it's a skill that can be learned and perfected with a bit of practice. 

This guide is by no means comprehensive, but my hope if that you'll find one or two useful pieces of information that help you on your way to a great career!

# Where did I come from?
My sordid history meant that I ended up coming to Curtin as a mature age student. In my previous life I had been a commercial diver, but after finding that there was more work for robots than humans in that industry, I decided that it was time to make a new start and begin to fight back against the machines.

The idea of starting a new degree in a new industry at age 34 was a bit scary, but after a couple of semesters I knew that I'd made the right decision. I ended up getting involved with the extra-curricular side of things, tutoring a few different units (Intro to Software Engineering, Unix and C Programming, and Design and Analysis of Algorithms), as well as running UniPass for Object Oriented Program Design. I also joined ComSSA in my second year, and was elected Vice President in my fourth semester, President in my fifth semester, and then had massive burnout and chucked it all in to focus on my studies :P Good times!

Career wise, I honestly didn't have a solid plan in mind. I knew what industry I wanted to be in, but I wasn't really sure what I enjoyed and where I wanted to work. During second year I started looking for internships, and after being knocked back at a few places (mostly due to lack of preparation I'd like to think...), I got accepted into the Woodside Summer Vacation program. I can't say that my internship was exactly what I was expecting, but I enjoyed Woodside and got on well with the people there. A month into my final year of study I was lucky enough to get an offer to join the grad program at Woodside, which I accepted. At the time of writing I've been there just over a year, and spent most of my first year cobbling together AWS infrastructure code to support app developers.

# 7 Uni tips that Curtin doesn't want you to know!
University presents students with an abundance of opportunities across loads of different areas. Sometimes it can seem like there are so many options that it can get overwhelming. However, don't despair! Just jump in and have a go. In my experience there's very few people that have a firm idea of who they are and where they're going. Life is a journey and sometimes it's best to just make a decision, any decision, and see if you like the outcomes. Having been one of the more venerable students in Computing I can assure you that it's never too late to change direction :)

In saying that, there's a few things I'd recommend doing if you're keen to get the most out of uni life:
* **Go to pracs and tutorials** - These are the best places to meet other students and learn from each other. While you might think that the development world is populated by super genius coders who work miracles on their own, I'm yet to meet a single decent developer who isn't also a good communicator. Working on these skills in your pracs is a good place to start, and it doesn't hurt if you make a few friends along the way.

* **Take on a teaching position if you can** - To extend on the previous point, being a good dev means being able to explain your ideas to your team. Teaching can also show a potential employer a few things - you're smart enough to teach, you can communicate an idea, and you're willing to put in extra work at uni. Jobwise, the pay is good, and you don't have to worry about commuting between work and uni. Plug - UniPass is especially good since it gets down to the fundamentals of how people learn, and the training is top notch!

* **Form study groups** - Yeah I know, all these points sound the same, but teaching others really is a great way to learn. I would often think that I understood something, but it wasn't until I went to explain it to another person that I realised there were all these gaps in my knowledge. 

* **Get involved outside of class** - Taking part in some of the extra-curricular programs on offer is a great way to meet new people and get exposed to new ideas. You might not realise it, but your CAF gets used to fund a lot of extra programs run by the uni, so get out there and enjoy them! Guild membership, industry mentor programs, leadership classes, there's a wealth of opportunities out there.

* **Join a club or two** - ComSSA was a huge part of my uni experience, and I can't imagine computing without it. There's so many great clubs, associations, and societies at Curtin and it can be a great experience giving back to them if you feel like it. I went to a lot of the revision sessions and industry talks by ComSSA in my first year and was honoured to have a chance to run some of them myself. You can also learn a lot about what it's like to work with a team of people and manage events, finances, and all the other stuff that comes with running a club.

* **Get familiar with the Cloud** - Apart from Distributed Computing and Capstone, you don't really get a chance to see how modern applications are designed. Pretty much all Industry applications are highly distributed and use some kind of Cloud infrastructure, and knowing how it all hangs together will make you A LOT more employable. There's three major players in the market: AWS  - Amazon, Azure - Microsoft, and GCP - Google. AWS has by far the biggest market share, followed by Azure, and then GCP as a distant third. They all follow similar, but not identical, architectures so moving between platforms isn't too difficult.

* **Don't stress** - You should always put your health first. If you feel like things are getting too much, drop a class or two, or even take a semester off. Look after yourself first, and remember that a bad grade or a failed class isn't the end of the world. You need energy and motivation to complete a degree, so you don't want to burn yourself out and come away from your degree feeling like you don't want to make a career in our wonderful industry. One of the best things about our industry is that it's extremely merit based. You don't need fantastic grades if you've got an awesome side project that you're super passionate about, and there's plenty of opportunities out there for everyone :)

# Ready, Set, Go!
Ok, so you're starting to think about an exit strategy from Uni. Then it's time to start looking for jobs! This can be daunting at the beginning. Knowing where to look, what to say, what to wear - there's a lot to it. The good news is that it's like anything else in life - it just takes a little practice and a bit of getting used to. Honestly, if you can master Dijkstra's Algorithm, then I'm pretty sure you can wrap your mind around a few job applications. So here's my tips:

* **Start early** - This is the NUMBER ONE tip. If you're waiting until the end of your final year, you're not going to be on the same level as those who learned their lessons early and figured out how to play the game before you. I'd recommend starting to think about internships at the start of your second year. A lot of companies use their intern programs as feeders for their grad programs, so you'll be at a huge advantage if you land an internship.

* **Practice interview questions** - There's a few different flavours of questions out there, and you'll need to have practiced them all. The interview is definitely the most important part of the application process and depending on where you're applying you may end up getting asked questions about coding, leadership, conflict resolution, personal and company values, and a bunch of others. If you can, I'd highly recommend practicing the questions with an actual real honest-to-god human. It feels dumb as hell rehearsing your answers like this, but hot tip - you're going to feel even dumber in the interview, especially if you stumble through your answers.

* **Spell checker is your friend** - While the interview is the most important part, you're not going to get there if you submit a shitty application. Good news is that it's not hard to submit a good one. Put together a resume - no more than two pages - and spell check it. A short, succinct, and well put together resume will trump a poorly-formatted, epic, life-story sized resume any day of the week. You won't get the job because of your great resume, but you can definitely lose it with bad one!

* **Pick a resume strategy that works for you** - There's a few different ways you can go with resumes. Once you get some experience under your belt, you'll want to focus on your employment history and the things you've done at work. However most students don't have much industry-relevant experience, so you'll need to convince prospective employers through other means. If you've worked on a bunch of personal projects, then list them and the outcomes you delivered. If you don't have a lot of projects, then you can focus on skills you've developed and provide some supporting evidence on how you developed them. You should pick a strategy - experience, projects, or skills - and then focus on building a resume that sells them. Go and see the Curtin Careers folks if you haven't written one before.

* **Get used to rejection** - Sorry, but unless you're extremely lucky then you're going to be on the receiving end of a few rejection letters. It feels crappy, but don't worry too much because it happens to even the best candidates. I think a lot of the time people get rejected not because they were unable to do the job, but because they failed to understand the application process. The more you do it, the more you'll learn, and the better you'll get until finally you get that sweet, sweet acceptance letter! 

# Other Junk
A few other miscellaneous bits and pieces to help you on your way:
* **HackerRank** - If you haven't already been to this site, go there now! It's a great place to practice small (or large) coding challenges, and get used to putting together your ideas quickly and efficiently. Some employers also use it for the coding portion of the application process.
* **Secure Code Warrior** - Security based coding challenges that cover a range of different attack vectors. Ironically I think this might be more useful for Software Engineers than Cyber students, since CCSEP isn't core to the SE stream, and Cyber students often don't end up writing a lot of code.
* **Cracking the Coding Interview (*Gayle MacDowell*)** - This is a classic, with lots of tips and questions on how to pass coding interviews, as well as a large collection of challenges you may be asked to solve in your interview. I'm pretty sure there's some (ahem)... digital copies... floating around if you're interested.
* **Curtin Careers** - There's lots of jobs for graduates on the site, and you can filter by industry. The employers advertising on the site are specifically looking for grads, so it'll have a lot of good opportunities at the level you need.
* **GradConnection** - This site has a lot of job postings for people starting out their career looking for grad positions.
* **LinkedIn** - Hmmm, I'm honestly not sure how useful this resource really is. Personally my best use case for it was as an online resume that I could point prospective employers to.
* **GlassDoor** - Reviews and info about working at companies written by current and ex-employees. Take it all with a grain of salt since there's certainly a lot of... salt (heyo!) to be found there. If you're dead set on working for a company then don't get discouraged by one bad review, but if you're finding lots of bad reports then it might be worth rethinking or consulting an existing employee. 
* **Developer Meetups** - There's plenty of meetup groups in Perth where you can meet like minded devs. They're not always wildly informative, but quantity over quality is the aim here. Eventually you'll get to know the other folks who attend and from time to time there are some really good presenters. Personally, I regularly head along to DevOps Perth, Perth Serverless, and AWS Users meetups. 
* **Conferences** - Latency, YOW, and of course DDD happen each year in Perth and can be a great way to hear some new ideas and meet some new people. They're not free, but you can get student discounts and early bird tickets if you're lucky.

# That's it!
Hey, congrats! You made it to the end! Hopefully you found something useful in there, and if not, then you definitely don't need any help, and will probably end up being my boss one day :P

Good luck and happy hunting!
