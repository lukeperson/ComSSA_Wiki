# Welcome to the ComSSA wiki 

This wiki was built to help computing students socially academically and career wise. Because uni is hard and you want to make the most of the experience. Inside you'll find tips from previous students, be wary that the tech industry changes rapidly and that career/job application advice may not apply anymore.
